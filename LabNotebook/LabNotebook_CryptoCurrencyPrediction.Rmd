# Data Collection

## Prices & Volume of Top Five Coins
Based on the website [Coin Market Cap](https://coinmarketcap.com/coins/), the following cryptocurrencies were the top 5 by market cap on 2-26-2018:    
* Bitcoin (\$BTC)    
* Ethereum (\$ETC)    
* Ripple (\$XRP)  
* Bitcoin Cash (\$BCH)  
* Litecoin (\$LTC)   
  
The R code below was used for data collection. The results were saved into [CryptoData-26-2-2018.RData](https://github.com/fmegahed/cryptopredictions/blob/master/LabNotebook/CryptoData-26-2-2018.RData) (which can be accessed by clicking the link on the hyperlink.) Note that the output includes a time-series object for each currency, which has the following variables/columns:   
* Open   
* High   
* Low   
* Close   
* Volume   
* Adjusted
